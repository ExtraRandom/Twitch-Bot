TODO finish this



To config the bot open the 'config.json' file in the bot directory.
If it does not exist run the bot once to generate one.

For 'NICK' set the value to be the bots name.
For example, if the bot was called 'ExampleBotName' then you should end
up with something that looks like:
```json
"NICK": "ExampleBotName",
```


Leave port, rate and host as they are.
